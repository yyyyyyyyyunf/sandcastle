 * Factory implementer entry point.
 *
 * The factory daemon spawns this script once per task with the following
 * environment variables populated:
 *
 *   FACTORY_REPO_PATH           Absolute path to the managed repo (also cwd).
 *   FACTORY_BRANCH              Branch name the task must commit onto.
 *   FACTORY_BASE                Base ref the branch is stacked on
 *                               (e.g. "origin/main" or "origin/<parent>").
 *   FACTORY_TASK_ID             Stable task identifier from the plan.
 *   FACTORY_TASK_DESCRIPTION    Human-readable task description.
 *   FACTORY_TASK_ISSUE_NUMBER   (optional) GitHub issue number, if the task
 *                               is linked to one. Absent otherwise.
 *
 * Exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure. Stdout/stderr are inherited by
 * the daemon. Commits landed on FACTORY_BRANCH will be pushed and opened
 * as a PR automatically.
